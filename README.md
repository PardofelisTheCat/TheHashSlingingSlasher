The Hash Slinging Slasher


This Repository were made to store my project for a class. I mainly used PHP for web and for daily uses i mainly used Java and C++ (though i plan to learn Kotlin someday) so.... This probably would take some time to finish lol

What it can do (For Now) :
* Add or Remove an Item List and Category
* Add a Category
* Fully Responsive Navbar
* Rickroll (lol)


TO DO List :
* Redo the Home Index page
* Prepare Database Connection 
* Add a Sidebar
* XSS Protection (Important, later)
* Tidy up the workspaces
